            <h2>Violet and the Little Volcano Story</h2>
            <p>Violet is a 9-year-old little girl! She recently got taught about volcanic mountains in school, and she would like to see one of them up close!<br> 
            That day, when Violet was leaving school, she put her hand in her pocket to take out the house key, but suddenly the key fell out of her hand and fell into a hole!<br>
            No matter how much Violet tried to get her key out of the pit, she couldn’t! A strange sound could be heard from inside the hole! Violet got scared and quickly ran away!
            But the whole night, she was thinking about the sound she heard from that pit!Violet lost her pencil in volcano
            Violet lost her pencil in volcano.The next day, Violet was returning from school with her friend Hannah! The apple in Hannah’s hands fell into the hole when they approached the pit.
            Hannah bent down to pick up the apple, but Violet yelled:Hannah, who couldn’t believe Violet’s words, bent down to pick up her apple, but suddenly she heard the strange voice that
             Violet had said! They ran away and thought about how to save the city from this dangerous volcano?! How should they not let that volcano grow big and strong?The next day in science class, Violet and Hanna decided to ask their teacher some questions about the legendary volcano:After school, Hanna and Violet returned to their little volcano and noticed that the crater was bigger than the day before! Hannah and Violet, who were very scared, quickly returned home!
            At dinner, Violet asked her big brother: What do you do if you find out that a volcano is growing in the street? Violet’s brother, who did not believe her words, said with a laugh:
             I will blow it, so it turns of Violet, who was angry, said:
             Be serious! I am not kidding!I do not know! Maybe I’ll call the fire department!
             
             The next day, Violet and Hanna decided to go to the city fire station. No matter how hard they tried, they could not convince the firefighters that a volcano had appeared on the street! But one of the firemen, who saw Violet and Hanna’s insistence, agreed to go with them and see the newborn volcano!
             
             When they reached the pit, they saw it had become bigger, and water was gushing out of it! Hannah and Violet shouted.
             
             Violet shows the pit to fireman
             Violet shows the pit to fireman
             The volcano has erupted!
             
             And then they hid behind the fireman! But the fireman said with a laugh:
             
             Do not be scared! This is not a volcano! The water pipe has burst! But you did a great help to the city with this good work! I will solve this problem very quickly now! Don’t worry at all!
             
             the fireman fixes the burst pipe
             the fireman fixes the burst pipe
             Hannah and Violet looked at each other! Violet said to Hanna:
             
             I think you were right! Volcanoes are in the mountains, not holes in the middle of the street!

            <h3>Noble Monkey</h3>
            <p>
                A huge group of monkeys lived deep in the forest a long time ago. The monkeys had a King who was large and powerful, and he ruled them well. The monkeys had discovered a mango tree growing along the river's edge. It was bursting with large, sweet mangoes.


"Don't allow a single mango to fall into the river," the wise monkey King warned all the monkeys. If you do, the river will take it to human settlements, and once they learn about this fruit, we will no longer be safe here, as they will come in quest of the fruit and destroy us in order to retain it for themselves." As a result, the monkeys were extra careful, and they always took care of the mangoes near the river's edge.



Noble Monkey


Without their knowledge, a large, ripe, and sweet mango fell into the river one day. The mango swam across the creek and landed on the other side. The clothing was being cleaned by the Royal washerman. He discovered the mango. It appeared to be delicious and juicy. He made the decision to present the mango to the King. "Your Majesty, I discovered this ripe, golden mango in the jungle on the bank of the river."


The mango was eaten by the King. He had never tasted a mango as sweet as this one. He wished for more of these mangoes. "The washerman found it floating on the river's edge," he explained. “It had to have sailed in from the other side of the river." As a result, he started to track down the mango's origins. He rode the boat to the other side of the stream with a few soldiers. They could see the mango tree from the boat. The King was delighted. He could finally eat the mangoes.
